# Agentic AI @ PhiData

Agentic-AI-PhiData is a compact demonstration of modular **Agentic AI** built using the phi framework, combining Groq-powered LLMs with tool-based reasoning for finance, web search, and document intelligence. The repo includes `playground.py` (initializes agents using `Groq(id="llama-3.1-8b-instant")`, `DuckDuckGo`, and `YFinanceTools` for live insights), `financial_agent.py` (an autonomous finance agent performing real-time stock and market analysis), and `PDFAssistant/pdfAssistant.py` (a document agent capable of reading, chunking, and reasoning over PDFs). All agents use environment variables (`.env` with `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) managed by dotenv, and dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Together, they showcase end-to-end agentic workflows for financial forecasting, web data retrieval, and PDF-based Q&A using tools like phi, Groq, DuckDuckGo, YFinanceTools, and OpenAI. Users can install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, run agents individually, and expand them into enterprise-scale RAG or multi-agent systems with future support for FAISS, Pinecone, and cross-agent communication. This project draws inspiration from the educational works of [**Krish Naik**](https://github.com/krishnaik06), whose tutorials continue to guide the next generation of AI engineers.
